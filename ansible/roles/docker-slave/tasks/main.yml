# When this role is being run when using Packer on the util slave, for some unknown reason
# it isn't allowed to access the Docker daemon. This is why the ignore errors flag is set.
# The solution was to add the docker login command as a separate shell script step in the Packer
# template. This still works running it in another context, e.g. a vagrant up, so I'm leaving it
# in and setting ignore errors, rather than taking it out entirely.
